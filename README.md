# Scriptable Object Architecture
 
//TODO

Known bugs and todo's:
Optimize type search for generation.
Unknown namespaces also get filled in in using (ex: "using ;" which errors)
Exclude non-serializable classes since they cant be generated properly
Generation is rushed and could be improved a lot in general...
Have generation over writing be selective per file...
Add reference to listvariables so they can be used from a monobehaviour
